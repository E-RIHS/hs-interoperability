## Model Relationships - across all activities
When looking at the interoprability of Heritage Science data one needs to define a whole range of different entities from people to GC-MS machines - work is being carried out to define the various generic types of entities that will be need. The work presented here is intended to describe how all of these different types of entities can be linked together to capture all of the metadata required to clearly define a HEritage Science dataset and the context in which it was generated and used. 

### Top Level Model Relationships 
Based on the concept of a Service offered via IPERION-HS or E-RIHS.
