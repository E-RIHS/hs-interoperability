  "service_description": "This Lux calculator is used to calculate the light allowance (in lux hours) for an object or groups of objects for a selected period of display. This is based on three main parameters: the type of objects being lit, the number of hours of light needed, and the desired light (lux) levels.\n\nThe period of time can be, for example, a whole year or just for the duration of a temporary exhibition. The standard example calculations provided are is based on figures quoted by Thomson in The Museum Environment and revisited by Saunders in Museum Lighting - A Guide for Conservators and Curators.\n\nThe total from the calculator represent the maximum allowed light exposure for the period rather than just one a target lux value. This total is the cumulative light dose or ‘allowance’, that must accommodates normal opening hours, maintenance and security arrangements and out-of-hours activities. To keep within the permitted light allowance, it may be necessary to limit the number and duration of out-of-hours activities and/or reduce the light levels for the duration of such activities.",
