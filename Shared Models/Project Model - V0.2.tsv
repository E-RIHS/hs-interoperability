Project	is identified by (1 to 1)	Project ID	thing|object
Project	is identified by (1 to 1)	Project Title	|name
Project	has note (1 to 1)	Project Summary	|note
Project Summary	tooltip	IPERION HS limits this to 300 words and have asked for it to include the novelty and/or added value of the proposed work.  - Should be a general top level description of the project. This description can change as a project is assessed and completed.
Project	was motivated by (1 to n)	Research Question	|idea
Research Question	tooltip	The IPERION HS proposal template asks for series of pieces of information which would all relate to the purpose and context of the project . This may need to be examined further. Also further descriptions of what these sub-sections covers (scope notes) are needed.
Research Question	should include	Scientific Background	|document
Scientific Background	tooltip	IPERION HS limits this to 300 words
Research Question	should include	Description of Work	|document
Description of Work	tooltip	IPERION HS limits this to 600 words - The experimental technique(s) requested with justification, required set-up(s), measurement strategy, sampling area/point details (number, location, etc.). This should be replaced by connections to Services and descriptions of actual Examinations.
Description of Work	describes the required (1 to n)	Service Method Statement	|document
Research Question	should include	Expected Achievements	|document
Expected Achievements	tooltip	IPERION HS limits this to 400 words
Research Question	should include	Impact plan	|type
Impact plan	tooltip	this could be a selection of options from a defined list. - IPERION HS has this as text limited to 400 words.
Research Question	should include (0 to n)	References	|object
Research Question	should include (0 to n)	Previous Relevant Analysis	|object
Previous Relevant Analysis	tooltip	IPERION HS has this as text limited to 300 words and is related to a specific artefact - ideally this should allow links to other projects or external descriptions of relevant events - it also needs to potentially relate to multiple artefacts or to Archives, samples, etc.
Project	used specific technique (1 to n)	Service Method Statement
Service Method Statement	tooltip	A project is linked to a Service Method Statement rather than just to a Service as it is important to connect a project to a timestamped version of a Service rather than the current status or description of a Service.
Project	includes the examination of (1 to n)	Object/Archive	|object
Object/Archive	tooltip	This relationship will need to be explored a bit more as this available CRM property 'used specific object' does not capture the nature of role of how an Object or Archive was used.
Project	had participant (1 to n)	Participant	|actor
Participant	in the role of	Role	|type
Role	tooltip	This relationship is required to allow different types of people to be linked to a project in the project form, but exact semantic relationships would need further detail.
Project	has time-span	Period	|period


Project	is documented in (1 to n)	Project Plan	|document_bn
Project Plan	tooltip	This is a time stamped/versioned record of the detailed captured for a given project - a new version of the Plan should be created and saved as the result of each version change. We still need to agree on what level of change should result in a new version.
Project Plan	has version	0.1.1	|dims_bn
0.1.1	tooltip	Versions should be applied automatically to saved instances of the Project Plan - levels of version changes could be agreed - for example editing existing text a change of 0.0.1 the addition of new meta data a change of 0.1.0 and status changes could be a change of 1.0.0 .... as noted above this relates to what level of change should determine the creation of a new version of the Project Plan.

Project	has type	Project Status	|type_bn
Project Status	tooltip	This should be assigned by the system based of the proposal development and assessment process - it should be selected from a controlled list of terms such as : wd:Q3918409 (proposal),  wd:Q560361 (draft document), wd:Q1121708 (failure), wd:Q7632586 (success), etc.

Project	was influenced by	Project Assessment	|event_bn
Project Assessment	can modify	Project Status
Project Assessment	can lead to	Project Update	|event_bn
Project Update	has modified	Project	

Project	was produced by	Project Creation	|event_bn
Project Creation	ongoing throughout	Creation Date	|period_bn
