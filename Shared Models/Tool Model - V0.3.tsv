Equipment	has (0 to n)	Acquisition/Target Area	|place
Acquisition/Target Area	tooltip	Needs to be refined further at this level it will probably be best to define a list of Classes here - specific relative locations would need to be defined in actual examination models
Equipment	has (0 to n)	Working Distance	|type
Working Distance	tooltip	This will need to be a drop of distance Classes rather than a specific value - actual values with dimensions will need to be stored in method statements.
