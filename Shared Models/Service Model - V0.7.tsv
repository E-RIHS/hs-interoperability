operating language	tooltip	What languages can the team operate in or what language is a tool presented in
readiness level	tooltip	It would be good to keep this to a simple list such as those used to describe software: Planning, Alpha, Beta, Release Candidate,or Production.
research discipline	tooltip	Need a controlled list here - which domains or disciplines has a given service worked within, has experience within:  conservation science, archaeology, anthropology, heritage science, materials science, computer science, digital humanities, information management, data processing, data management
technique	tooltip	A list of the individual relevant heritage science examination and analytical techniques carried out within this Service: GCMS, Neutron Beam Analysis, Hyper-spectral imaging, etc. - selected from a publicly defined controlled list.	
access level	tooltip	At what level are accesses available - Global, EU, National, Institutional
service platform	tooltip	Controlled list, value selected from: ARCHLAB, DIGILAB, FIXLAB, and MOLAB.	
service function	tooltip	An externally defined service practical level activity, what has a service been used for, what is it intended for: Need to be clear about overlap with category: Materials Analysis, Dye Analysis, De-convolution XRF Spectra, Calculating Light Exposure Allowance, etc.
service category	tooltip	An externally defined service top level categories defining what types of work the included techniques are used to carry out: Identification of Inorganic Pigments, Analysis of Archaeological Pottery, Preventive Conservation, Materials Analysis, Signal Processing, File Formatting and Validation, Other Standards, Ontologies & Vocabularies, Data Repositories, PID services, Metadata Modelling, Documentation, Collection Care, etc.  - selected from a publicly defined controlled list. - Need to be clear about the overlap with Discipline.

//subgraph General Documents
Service Description	tooltip	A longer description of a specific technical or access service offered within the IPERION-HS project or under E-RIHS
Method	tooltip	Service related method statements should be defined the Method model and represent the procedures for using individual pieces of equipment or software systems used within the service - detail of setup, methodology, procedures, etc. should all be described within this document and is also directly attached to relevant the Tool (equipment or software) records.
Input Limitations	tooltip	This section may need to be more complex but it might be simplified to a controlled list with optional related values – Does it work on samples or complete objects – will it damaged or destroy samples – what are the size limitations on samples or objects – are the results of other examination required – do the input samples/objects/files need to be prepared or formatted in a specific way – the full extent of this will need to be discussed.
Service Data Management Plan	tooltip	An open description of the data management procedures followed with the defined service, including licence issues, preferred data repositories, publication embargoes, common file formats, software and systems used, etc.	
Service E-RIHS DMP Variation	tooltip	Differences may be required in relation to national, funding or institutional limitations – some differences could be easily manageable but other might require updates to the E-RIHS DMP	
Workflow Description	tooltip	A diagram or written description - (a standard diagram format might be easier to compare) More complex services, multiple pieces of equipment or data processing steps, might benefit for a summary description of the key stages, including details of any required background information, direct input from users and any processing steps.
Other Comments	tooltip	Free text opportunity to advocate for what is novel or special about this particular access

//subgraph Administration Fields
Access Count	tooltip	For new services this would need to be based on past experience of the provider if applicable, or related to the relevant resources that can be provided. For automated digital tools this count could be based on previous use metrics or estimated in relation to the planned dissemination plan. For running services this count could represent and average of the recorded value for the previous year - a record of the count for each year should be stored.	
access unit	tooltip	For previously defined services this has commonly been defined in days or occasionally hours - but with the development of digital services additional smaller time units might be needed
Access Cost	tooltip	The full costs of a unit of access.
Access Hours per Unit	tooltip	Accesses Units are describe as time periods, but depending on the nature of a service this might relate to a range of different periods of activity time. For example a day could relate to a working day or a calendar day, a digital service could relate to run time or processing time. So this value is used to relate actual activity time to the recorded access unit.
Checked Date	tooltip	All services need to be check periodically to ensure the Service Record is up-to-date.
KPI	tooltip	or Key Performance Indicators - these will need further description, but will be defined by E-RIHS if needed rather than the provider.
Yes/No#-2	tooltip	Boolean choice.
