Research Activity	tooltip	Within the scope of this system an Research Activity is seen as a specific  event of examining a single object or archive, etc. It is anticipated that within future user interfaces options will be provided to duplicated Research Activities to create multiple similar events relating to different objects or to construct series of measurements on a single object.
Research Question	tooltip	Brief description of relevant Research Questions - unique issues or questions this Research Activity aims to address.
Research Activity Description	tooltip	This additional, optional, comment is intended to allow comments to be made in relation to the practical Research Activity event. Any additional information that might be of use.
Location PID	tooltip	This value relates to the venue or location in/at which the Research Activity is carried out - this might relate to an institution, a museum, or even a outdoor location. This value should relate to a location PID related to location details defined elsewhere.

Condition Class	tooltip	Initially the classes of condition are anticipated to include Colour, State and Texture, but more could be added as required.	
Condition Value	tooltip	Intended to be offered as controlled lists of type values related the condition class - Yellow, Blue, Cream, etc | Worn, Damaged, Cleaned, Varnished, etc. | Rough, Smooth, etc.	
//Examination Methodology	tooltip	More complex examinations incorporating multiple pieces of equipment may required more global metadata fields above and beyond those for each individual piece of equipment. This could relate to the order of activities or even the relative organisation of the equipment used. A more general comments are already defined for each Examination.	
//Default Equipment Methodology PID	tooltip	The equipment setup and method will need to be defined by a range of metadata fields specific to a given type of equipment and type of application. The standard conditions can be defined as a reusable set of values identified by a setup/method ID.	
//Equipment Methodology	tooltip	The equipment setup and method will need to be defined by a range of metadata fields specific to a given type of equipment and type of application. The changeable conditions, unique to a given examination can be defined as a set of values specifically attached to a given examination.

//subgraph
_archive examination	tooltip	Archive Examinations may simply documented as an examination of the archive as a whole, but the possibility of needing to document the examination of multiple resources within a given archive may also need to be considered.

Output Dataset PID	tooltip	Within the scope of this system Data, our the notion of a Data Set is used to describe all of the outputs created during an examination - this can relate analytical datasets or gathered notes and images. The examination model does not define the metadata of this created Data/Data Set just a link to the relevant PIDs.
