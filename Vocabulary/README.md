# Vocabulary Tools and Services - Options for E-RIHS

[![E-RIHS Vocabulary Requirements](https://img.shields.io/badge/Vocabulary-Requirements-blue)](./requirements.md)

A list of vocabulary related tools and services which could be exploited by E-RIHS or the wider Heritage Science Community 

E-RIHS is the European Research Infrastructure for Heritage Science that supports research on heritage interpretation, preservation, documentation and management. The mission of E-RIHS is to deliver integrated access to expertise, data and technologies through a standardized approach, and to integrate world-leading European facilities into an organisation with a clear identity and a strong cohesive role within the global heritage science community.

A major part of this work directly relates to the language and terms used to describe heritage science research and research resources and this list has been brought together to highlight a range of useful Vocabulary tools and services, but also act as a focus for discussions about which resources will be directly exploited by E-RIHS.

## More Resources

The lists below are a great place to start for inspiration and tooling, but they are certainly not complete!

If you have a link or a resource to add, you have a few options: 
- check out the [Contributing Guidelines](./contributing.md) linked just above for  a description of the current procedure.
- [open a new issue ticket](https://github.com/E-RIHS/hs-interoperability/issues) mentioning the link or resource you want to add and some description, and the community may be able to help add it

Likewise, if there are other ways to see how people are implementing vocabulary solutions please do let us know and we can agree on the best way to highlight examples of best practice and or just interesting implementations.

**Disclaimer**: The lists below are presented in alphabetical order within each section, and do not suggest any recommendation. Likewise, these lists are created for informational purposes only and any links do not constitute an endorsement, recommendation, or favouring by the E-RIHS community.
