## The Record Model - related to all activities
One of the important aspects of the E-RIHS Digital Infrastructure will be a process of helping researchers find the digital tools and services they may need to use. The models listed here are intended to define the metadata needed to describe the various Tools, Software, Services and Research Resources. This is not intended to be a exhaustive or documentation based description, it should me more of a catalogue entry similar to the existing catalogue of services currently used to list the physical services offered via ARCHLAB, FIXLAB and MOLAB. The key issues here is ensuring there is enough information to group and filter records and allow researchers to find the things they need and understand the general areas in which they can be used.
