`The SSHOC Reference Ontology (SSHOCro) proposes an ontological model and RDF schema to be used as a top-level ontology for organizing knowledge and information found distributed across various primary sources of information in the Social Sciences and Humanities Open Cloud (SSHOC). It provides a semantic interoperability framework for the description of the data life cycle used by Social Science and Humanities researchers.` - https://sshopencloud.eu/sshocro
