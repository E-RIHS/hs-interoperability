# Heritage Science Interoperability
Ongoing work in relation to the IPERION-HS project to explore methods to improve interoperability across Heritage Science data. At this stage we are working to define the required meta and para-data needed to ensure that data gathered during technical examinations can be FAIR. To achieve this we are currently working on a number of steps:

## Current Development
Comments and descriptions still to be added
1. **Define discrete Re-usable data modules:** This work is currently ongoing - see [here](./Shared%20Models/README.md)
2. **Map the relationships between data modules:**
3. **Define the core meta data fields needed for each data module:**
4. **Define the generic JSON schema template for each data module:**
5. **Define the specific versions of these JSON schema templates:**
6. **Define initial storage for gathered metadata:**
7. **Begin to gather test metadata:**

## Future Work
1. **Define production data storage and search options:**
2. **Integrate existing data into the process of gathering new related data:**

## Related Tools and Services
Here are some of the tools being used or considered as part of this work:
### The Dynamic Modeller
An interactive live modelling system which can automatically convert simple tab separated triples into graphical models using the [mermaid library](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid). 
- Code: https://github.com/jpadfield/dynamic-modelling
- Live tool: https://research.ng-london.org.uk/modelling/
- https://github.com/bumbu/svg-pan-zoom also being considered for presentation of models.

### Json Form Editors
Both of these systems are currently being considered for the auto generation of the forms from agreed JSON schema templates.
- https://bytes.kikirpa.be/form-generator/ (https://github.com/KIKIRPA/form-generator)
- https://github.com/json-editor/json-editor

### Json Validators
