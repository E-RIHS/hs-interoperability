# Heritage Science Interoperability
Ongoing work in relation to the IPERION-HS project to explore methods to improve interoperability across Heritage Science data. At this stage we are working to define the required meta and paradata needed to ensure that data gathered during techinical examinations can be FAIR. To achieve tis we are currently working on a number of steps:

## Current Development
Comments and descriptions still to be added
1. **Define descrete Re-usable data modules:** This work is currently ongoing - see [here](./Shared%20Models/README.md)
2. **Map the relationships between data modules:**
3. **Define the core meta data fields needed for each data module:**
4. **Define the generic JSON schema template for each data module:**
5. **Define the specific versions of these JSON schema templates:**
6. **Define initial storage for gathered metadata:**
7. **Begin to gather test metadata:**

## Future Work
1. **Define production data storage and search options:**
2. **Integrate existing data into the process of gathering new related data:**
