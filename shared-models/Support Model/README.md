It has been described as Funding Programme before. It began with the idea of defining the source of funding for a given service, but it has been discussed that different types of support might be provided along with multiple instances so a more flexible relationship is required. Also, actual institutions/organisations can be defined separately as types of Actors so they can be linked or referenced here rather than being defined again. |
