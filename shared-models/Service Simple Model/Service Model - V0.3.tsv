Service#-1	has dimension (1 to 1)	Access Count	|dims_bn
Access Count	tooltip	For new services this would need to be based on past experience of the provider if applicable, or related to the relevant resources that can be provided. For automated digital tools this count could be based on previous use metrics or estimated in relation to the planned dissemination plan. For running services this count could represent and average of the recorded value for the previous year - a record of the count for each year should be stored.	
Service#-1	has dimension (0 to 1)	Access Unit	|type

Access Hours per Unit	tooltip	Accesses Units are describe as time periods, but depending on the nature of a service this might relate to a range of different periods of activity time. For example a day could relate to a working day or a calendar day, a digital service could relate to run time or processing time. So this value is used to relate actual activity time to the recorded access unit.
