# Shared Models - across all activities
Handling and sharing data related to MOLAB, FIXLAB, ARCHLAB or JRA Projects may require specific data models to be considered or developed to ensure that all of the appropriate metadata is recorded in relation to our work, however. There are several parts of the research data life cycle that can rely on common
models for the data to be collected, generated or processed and preserved. Details of these shared models will be included here. Similar models specifically related to the various Techniques used within MOLAB, FIXLAB, ARCHLAB or JRA Projects will be documented in dedicated folders.
