The model has been extended to include the notion of the development or versioning or the project through proposal to success or failure. Further work will be required to determine how best to define the Research Questions (ideas that are motivating the project). |

Within this model the detais of any listed objects, samples, sites, etc., that are being examined, are only referenced and will need to be collected or defined in a separate form based on the Simple Object Model. |
