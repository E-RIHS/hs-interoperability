PID(s)	has note	PIDs are persistent identifiers used to define given entities either within IPERION-HS, within E-RIHS or more generally. They act as the nodes or connection points within knowledge graphs.	|note
PID(s)	has note	PIDs will generally require a robust versioning procedure to ensure developments of the same entity can be linked together and things can be linked to the appropriate version of other things rather than the current state.
