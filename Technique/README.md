# Techniques - Metadata and documentation requirements.
Ongoing work in relation to the IPERION-HS project to explore methods to improve interoperability across Heritage Science data

At this time the work is being considered in relation to each technique, which will then be related to more general shared models. The techniques listed here relate to ones which are being considered or are planned to be considered. Further techniques can be included as needed if people have time to work on them.
