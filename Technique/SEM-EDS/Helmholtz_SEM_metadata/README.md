## NFFA EUROPE Pilot / MDMC Helmholtz SEM metadata schema

´´´
Many groups within the broad field of Materials Science are already developing metadata schemas and ontologies, driven by their individual organizational
goals and guided by the open and FAIR data initiatives (e.g., EOSC, Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe, Turning FAIR into reality). However,
to promote interoperability, a harmonization approach to find a common description of the data coming from the measurements needs to be developed and
should be adopted as far as possible.
Motivated by this, we started a coordination effort between the two projects
we are directly involved in: the NFFA (Nanoscience Foundries and Fine Analysis)
EUROPE Pilot (NEP) and the Joint Lab “Integrated Model and Data
Driven Materials Characterization” (MDMC) of the Helmholtz Association.
Our final objective is to describe the entire workflow of an experimental project,
providing rich metadata to make data interoperable. This is an incremental
process; as a first use case, we developed a metadata schema to describe Scanning
266Electron Microscopy (SEM) measurements. This schema is aiming to become a
de-facto standard for SEM and to pave the way towards further extension to
other electron microscopy techniques.

Comment from Wim Fremout:
This metadata schema allows for an (too?) extensive description of SEM and FIB experiments, but lacks (in my opinion) detail in detector parameters, and in particular for EDX experiments. Might provide a good basis, but requires evaluation by other labs.
