## Reflectance Spectroscopy Models and Related Discussion
Many aspects of documenting accesses or research in relation to this technique, such as Services, Samples, Objects, Projects, etc. will be covered by [Shared Models](../../Shared%20Models). However, this space will be used to define more technique specific details and demonstrate how the technique can connect to the [Shared Models](../../Shared%20Models).
